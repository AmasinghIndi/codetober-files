# Celestial Odyssey Terraform Configurations

Welcome to the Celestial Odyssey Terraform repository! This repository contains the Terraform configurations for the Celestial Odyssey spaceship project, an ambitious mission to explore the outer reaches of the Milky Way.

## Overview

The Celestial Odyssey is a state-of-the-art spaceship designed for deep space exploration. This repository hosts the infrastructure-as-code (IaC) configurations needed to manage various components of the spaceship, including the powerful XJ-9000 engine.

## Repository Structure

- **aircraft_engine.tf**: Defines the configuration for the XJ-9000 engine, including its model, capacity, and security password.

## Terraform Resource Definitions

### Aircraft Engine Configuration

```hcl
resource "aircraft_engine" "my_engine" {
  model     = "XJ-9000"
  capacity  = "2000"
  password  = "securePass123!"
}
```

This configuration defines the key attributes of the spaceship's engine:
- **model**: Specifies the model of the engine.
- **capacity**: Indicates the engine's capacity.
- **password**: A secure password for engine access.

## Getting Started

To use these configurations, ensure you have Terraform installed and configured on your local machine. Clone this repository and navigate to the directory containing the `aircraft_engine.tf` file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/celestial-odyssey-config.git
cd celestial-odyssey-config
```

Run Terraform commands to initialize and apply the configurations:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```
